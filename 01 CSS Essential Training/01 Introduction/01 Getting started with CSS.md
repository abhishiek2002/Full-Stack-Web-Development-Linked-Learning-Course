Getting started with CSS
- CSS is a fundamental part of web design because it controls how your webpages look. Without it, websites would only display text on white backgrounds. Use CSS to take your plain HTML websites to the next level. Whether you're just trying to customize your Squarespace page or contemplating a career switch, learning the essentials of CSS from the ground up gives you the ability to do everything from tweaking existing CSS to writing your own. By the end of this course, you'll have an actual project. An online portfolio and resume page. I'm Christina Truong, and I invite you to join me from my course on LinkedIn Learning where I'll cover the foundations of CSS. Let's get started.
