## Main Concepts

### 1. What is CSS?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the language used to style and design web pages.
It defines how elements should be displayed â€” such as **colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing**.

Without CSS, web pages appear as **plain text on a white background**.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
```

Without CSS, it looks basic.
With CSS:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
```

Now the text appears more styled and readable.

**Explanation:**
CSS helps web designers make websites attractive, organized, and user-friendly.
