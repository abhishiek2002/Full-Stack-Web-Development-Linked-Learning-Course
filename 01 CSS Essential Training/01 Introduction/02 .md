What you should know
- [Instructor] We'll be learning about CSS from the ground up, so you don't need any prior knowledge. However, having a basic understanding of HTML and being comfortable with general computer tasks such as creating files and folders or using multiple apps simultaneously, will help you get the most out of this course. If at any point you have any questions about HTML, I'd encourage you to check out our "HTML Essential Training" course.
