## Main Concepts

### 1. No Prior CSS Knowledge Required

You can start learning **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** from scratch — no previous experience is necessary. The course is designed for complete beginners.

However, having some familiarity with **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) will make it easier to follow along.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
```

CSS will later be used to style these elements.

**Explanation:**
CSS and HTML work together. HTML creates the structure of a webpage, and CSS controls how it looks (color, layout, font, etc.).

### 2. Helpful Skills Before Starting

While you don’t need to be a developer, it’s beneficial to be **comfortable with general computer tasks**, such as:

* Creating and organizing **files and folders**.
* Using **multiple applications at once** (like a browser and code editor).
* Navigating your **computer’s file system**.

**Why it matters:**
These skills will help you when working with **code editors**, managing **project folders**, and previewing your websites in browsers.
