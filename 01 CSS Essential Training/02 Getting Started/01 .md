HTML and CSS
- In this course we'll be focusing on the fundamentals of CSS, but we'll also have discussions about HTML because these two languages work closely together. HTML was originally created for sharing research documents. So the space between paragraphs and bold headings are examples of default browser styles which were created to make text easier to read. Though HTML elements are displayed with these basic styles, avoid choosing a particular element because of the way it looks. That's what CSS is for. Instead use HTML to define the structure of the document and add meaning to the content. CSS, on the other hand, controls the appearance of the document and separates presentation from the content. Throughout this course, we'll be working with HTML, but it's not the focus. And as you're following along, if you have any questions about HTML that we're not covering, I would encourage you to check out HTML Essential Training for more details. We'll also be building out a real world project, a personal website. So before getting into the essentials of CSS, we'll start with an overview of how to set up a development environment and prepare our course project files.
