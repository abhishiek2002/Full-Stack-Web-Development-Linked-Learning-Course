Creating a color palette
- [Instructor] The final version of the project for this course uses four colors: A light color for the background. A light color for the heading underlines. Two colors for the links and buttons, and a dark color for the footer. This is what my color palette looks like. If you want to use the same colors, this information is included in a colors text file in the exercise files folder. Picking a color palette can take some time so let's look at some tools that can help. One option is Canva, which offers a variety of tools. You can upload an image into their Color Palette Generator or just try one of their demo images. It will automatically create a palette matching the photo. Their other tools include preset palettes to choose from, which you can filter by color, themes, and keywords. There's also a tool based on the color wheel. Start by picking a color, then choose a combination based on color theory concepts such as complimentary colors or monochromatic colors. Or you can try coolors.co to generate a color palette. Press the space bar for more options, and if you find a color that you like, press the lock icon to keep them and the space bar again to generate more colors. Take a moment to create your own color palette or feel free to use mine. We'll need these colors for the remainder of the project exercises.
