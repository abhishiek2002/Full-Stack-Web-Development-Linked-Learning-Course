Intro to responsive design
- When I started building websites back in 2006, we didn't have to worry too much about different screen sizes. Most people were still browsing websites on desktops and laptops, but there were a couple of major developments around that time that started the push towards more widespread mobile browsing. The Opera Mini browser was introduced in 2005 with the hopes of finally bringing mobile internet into the mainstream. The first iPhone was introduced in 2007, which took mobile browsing to the next level by including a touch screen. Companies were starting to realize they needed to optimize for smaller screens. In 2010, Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design in his article for the publication, "A list apart." In the article he said, "Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries are the three technical ingredients for responsive web design." But it also requires a different way of thinking. Rather than quarantining our content into device specific experiences, we can use media queries to progressively enhance our work within different viewing contexts. This way of designing was once considered an extra feature, but these days, we can access the web on many different devices. So responsive web design can no longer be an afterthought. By creating websites that work seamlessly on any device, we can improve the user experience and make our websites accessible to a wider audience.
