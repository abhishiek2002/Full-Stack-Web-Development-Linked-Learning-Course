Continuing beyond the essentials with CSS
- [Instructor] We've covered a lot in this course, but mainly focused on the foundations of CSS and how to get started. If you want to know where to go next, there are more intermediate and advanced topics to explore such as CSS animations, using icon fonts, and even a deeper dive into the topics we did cover, such as grid, flexbox, and other less commonly used properties and more advanced selectors. You can even try to build out the project again from scratch or check out some of our other CSS courses in the library. Learning CSS is just like learning any other type of language. It's going to take more than a few hours to become fluent. Thanks for watching the course.
