JavaScript: The soil from which the modern web grows
- JavaScript is the soil from which modern web applications grow. That may sound poetic or pompous, but it's also the truth. The modern web runs on JavaScript and so do your modern servers and even the development environments on our computers. If you want to work on or with the web today, a solid understanding of JavaScript is both necessary and hugely valuable. Know the foundational elements of JavaScript and you're well-equipped to build the web of tomorrow whether that's through vanilla JavaScript, a modern JavaScript framework, like React or View, in the JAMstack or a node based server environment or in JavaScript powered applications and environments we haven't even developed yet. If HTML is the language of web content and CSS is the language of web style, JavaScript is the language of web applications that bring all of this together. And in this course, you'll get a deep and broad introduction to modern JavaScript and how to make sense of it. When I took a computer science class back in the late 1990s the professor said JavaScript is just a passing fad. Today, some two decades later, JavaScript is the primary language for everything we do on the web. And I am privileged to have the opportunity to help you make sense of it all and make it part of your professional toolkit. Let's get cracking.
