Practice: Build a new object with a constructor
- Classes feature heavily in modern JavaScript frameworks and getting comfortable with writing and using them will be a huge asset to you as you started working with advanced JavaScript sites and applications. To help you solidify your understanding of classes right away here's a practice assignment for you. In the practice files you'll find the backpack class we've been working with so far. Using this class as a reference, I want you to create new classes based on one or more of the objects you created in the previous practice sessions. I recommend creating separate files for each class and importing them as modules so you have a clear separation of concerns. The easiest approach to building a new class is to start with a fully built out object and then migrate the properties and methods over one by one. Then once the class is complete, you can test it by recreating the original object using that class. Build several classes and objects based on those classes. Make sure each class has several properties and at least one method interacting with those properties and test the objects created from the classes in the browser console to make sure everything is working properly.
