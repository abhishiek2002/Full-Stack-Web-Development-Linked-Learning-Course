Mastering search
- [Instructor] A big part of finding the right answer to your query is knowing where to search and how to search. In the previous chapter, I introduced the source pyramid to provide some guidance on where to search for information. Now, we'll turn to the question of how to perform a successful search. The key here is understanding how search systems work and how to get them to give you the results you're looking for. The challenge with any type of internet search is there is so much information out there and everyone does everything in their power to drive you towards their information because the internet economy runs on visits and engagement. Search engines use advanced algorithms to try to guide you towards the most credible sources of information for what you're looking for, and they also try to make sense of your searches to give you the most relevant information. Even so, their search results are often not quite as accurate as you'd want them to be, and you'll need to do some more work to get the information you actually need. The good news is we can go beyond basic search strings to take advantage of advanced tools and techniques to help the search engines find what we're looking for. And in some cases, we can skip the search engines entirely and go directly to the sources to perform more in-depth searches. There's a lot of ground to cover here. And by the end of this chapter, you'll have a huge toolkit to master search.
