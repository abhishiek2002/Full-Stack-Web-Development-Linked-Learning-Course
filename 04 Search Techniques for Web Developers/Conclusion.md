The end
- [Instructor] All right, we've reached the end of our journey together. Now you have the skills and know-how to supercharge your searches and find the answers you're looking for faster and with less work. As you bring what you've learned in this course into your own practice, keep a couple of things in mind. First, the pyramid. Anytime you find information, figure out where it belongs in the pyramid, and make sure if your information belongs in the lower levels that you check with the higher ones for accuracy. Second, take some time to really learn the advanced features built into the search systems you're using. They're always really well-documented, and I've provided links throughout the course. And when in doubt, you can always do a search for how to do an advanced search using X. And finally, use community sources liberally, and make yourself part of the community. It might feel scary or intimidating at first, but one of the best things you can do as a developer is find like-minded people to share your trials and tribulations and questions and knowledge with. Community is how you grow, and the community will grow with your contributions. Now all that's left for me to say is (indistinct) go find what you're looking for, and I'll see you in the next course.
