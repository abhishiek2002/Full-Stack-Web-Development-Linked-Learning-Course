What you should know
- This course aims to be as approachable as possible, no matter your background. We're starting from the very beginning, so you don't need any prior knowledge of Git. You also don't need to know any specific programming languages. This course is all about the basics of Git. If you want to follow along, you can use GitHub Codespaces, which will give you the exact same setups I'm using. The process will be explained in a later video. But you're also welcome to use your own device, whether it's Windows, Linux, or MacOS. We will work from the command line, so it is helpful if you're already comfortable with that. In the codespace, we'll use a Linux command line, but you can also use other command lines, like PowerShell if you prefer. This course won't focus on coding or any particular programming language. We'll use simple markdown files as examples. If you are not familiar with markdown, that will not stop you from following along. Finally, we will not cover all that Git can do as it would take forever. Instead, the goal here is to get you comfortable with the basics so you can start using Git in your daily coding.
