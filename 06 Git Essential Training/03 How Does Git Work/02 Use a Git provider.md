Use a Git provider
- [Narrator] In the last video, we saw how we could use Git locally. Now let's move on and see how we can push our code to a remote repository. By doing this, we can access it from other devices or work together with other people. When we want to bring our latest snapshots out of our local repository to the remote repository, we use the command Git Push, and that's it. All the committed files are now pushed to the remote repository. Remember that any changes that are only stored locally or in the staging area will not be pushed. Now, let's say we're on a different device and we want to retrieve those files from the remote repository or work with a repository that others have added code to. To do that, we use the command Git Pull. This command pulls all the files from the remote repository and puts them not only in the local repository, but also in our local folder. Now we can work with them and we always have the latest version.
