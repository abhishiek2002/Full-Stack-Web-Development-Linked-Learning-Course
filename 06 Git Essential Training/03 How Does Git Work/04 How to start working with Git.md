How to start working with Git
- We've covered the basics of Git, and now it's time to put that knowledge into practice. But before we do, I want to share a few tips with you. First, Git is hard. People who have been using it for years sometimes forget how tough it was at the beginning. So if you are feeling stuck, don't get discouraged. Take your time, go at your own pace, and it will start to make sense. Another thing to keep in mind is that Git has a lot of features and options. There's so much you can do, but you don't need to learn it all at once. I recommend to focus on the basics, like what we're covering in this course, and just start using Git in your daily work. When I started out, I found branches confusing, so I didn't use them. I started with just consistently adding my own code into repositories. Once I was comfortable with that, I found it easier to move on with branches and cooperating with others. So go your own pace. Even experienced Git users don't know every single command or how to solve every problem. The key is to get started and if you run into trouble, you can always look up solutions online. With that said, let's jump in and start using Git ourselves.
