Git GUI clients
- [Instructor] Git is a command line tool, but as we have seen, keeping track of file history can get complicated, especially in long running projects. That's where Git GUI clients come in. These tools help visualize Git's process, making it easier to understand what is happening in a repository. You can find a list of available Git GUI clients on the official website, git-scm.com. Just go to downloads and then look for the GUI clients. We can view them here and we can find a variety of options. For all the options we can see on what operating systems they work. Some of these are free while others are paid. You can find out here what works best for you or ask your coworkers for recommendations. In the next video, we'll take a closer look at one of these GUI clients, Visual Studio Code.


Optional: Install Visual Studio Code
- [Instructor] I want to give a special mention to Visual Studio Code, one of the available GUI clients. Visual Studio Code or VS Code for short has built in support for Git, giving you a good starting point to work with. But beyond that, there is also some great extensions and it can help you with the process. Working with Visual Studio Code is very similar to the experience with Codespaces. To install Visual Studio Code go to code.visualstudio.com. You can download VS Code directly via the button or click the download button at the top right here to get available options. I am going to use the system installer for Windows as I am an admin on this computer. Once the file is downloaded, we can open it from here and it'll open up a wizard. Accept the agreement and click next. For a quick installation, we are going to keep all the default values. We'll click install and once it's finished we are able to launch Visual Studio Code. Now that we have Visual Studio Code running, I can open the extensions menu and search for git. You will see several useful options. Some of the most popular ones are Git Graph, Git History, and GitLens. These can help you track changes, see who has last modified the file, and visualize your project's history. So see about the options and find out what might help you. If you're new to Git, using a GUI can make things much easier. So it's worth exploring these tools and find out what works best for you.
