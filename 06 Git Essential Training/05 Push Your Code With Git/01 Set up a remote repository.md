Set up a remote repository
- In this chapter, we'll create a remote repository to practice using Git. A remote repository is stored on a Git provider. This is a cloud service where you can keep your Git projects just like you would locally. Since it's in the cloud, you can access it anywhere and pull your code onto different computers. There are several Git providers to choose from, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. While their interfaces might look different, they all follow the same core concepts, so once you learn one, switching to another is easy. We are going to use GitHub for this course as it also makes it possible for us to use GitHub Codespaces. If you don't have an account yet, head to github.com and sign up. It's completely free. All you need is an email address and the process will explain itself. Once you have logged in, you have the option to create your own repositories. We will see how that works before we set up the repository that we will use for this course. We can create a new repository by using the URL github.com/new. When creating a repository, you need to fill in a few details. First, we choose the repository name. Since this will be part of the URL, it's best to avoid spaces. I'll call mine git-repository, and I see it's available. If you want, this is also where you can add a description. Next, decide whether your repository should be public or private. A public repository means anyone can view your code, but no one will be able to edit it. A private repository is only visible to you unless you share access with specific people. For this example, I'll keep this one private. Now, you see an option to initialize the repository. You can add a README file, a gitignore file, or choose a license. A README file is a best practice for any repository, so I'm going to include one. The other options aren't necessary for now, but I encourage you to explore them later to see how they can help you manage your project. Once everything is set, click Create repository. And just like that, in a few seconds, our repository is ready. You can create as many repositories as you want. Follow along with the next video to set up the repository that we will use for this course.
