Fork the course repository
- [Instructor] Let's set up a repository that we can use for this course. This will make it easier for you to follow along, which I highly recommend. To do this, we are going to fork a repository. Forking means that we can take a repository that we don't own ourselves and we can create our own copy. That copy will be stored in our account and we are able to start working with it without changing anything in the original repository. In theory, you could use forking to make contributions to an existing repository that you don't own, but that part is out of the scope of this course. For now, go to the URL that you can see on the screen. At the top, you will see a button with Fork. When we click that, we can create a fork in our own account. You can change the name of the repository if you want to, or you can just leave everything at the default. Click Create Fork right at the bottom to create your own version of the repository. Note that a fork will always be a public repository, so you do not have the option to make it a private one. You are now ready to follow along with this course.
