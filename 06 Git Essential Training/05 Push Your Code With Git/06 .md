Push the file to the remote repository
- [Instructor] In this video, we will make sure that the changes in our local repository are pushed to the remote repository. Going back to our environment, we have a file in our local repository that hasn't been pushed to the remote repository yet. We ran git status, and we can see that our local branch is ahead of the remote one, and it tells us exactly what to do next. We need to use git push. Let's go ahead and do that. Enter, and that's it. The changes have now been pushed to our remote repository, so let's check if it actually worked. I'll open the web interface and refresh, and there we can see that Example.md has been added. You can also see the commit message we set earlier, adds Example.md to demonstrate the git process. So, there we go. We have now pushed our change to the remote repository.
