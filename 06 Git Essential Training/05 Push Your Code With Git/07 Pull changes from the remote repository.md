Pull changes from the remote repository
- [Instructor] Sometimes there will be changes on the remote repository that you want to pull to your local device. Maybe you are on a different device or maybe someone else pushed code to the remote repository. Let's see how we can pull those changes. So our starting point would be a remote repository that has newer files than our local repository. We say that the remote repository is ahead of the local one. Let's first create a situation where we actually have something to pull. If you are using a code space, make sure the one you were using is still opened up or open a new one before you take the next step. So we have the GitHub repository in the web interface. You can now click on add file, and then create new file. Call the file example 02.MD and add some text to your liking. At the top, you can now click Commit Changes. A Default Commit message is already provided, so let's leave it as it is and click on Commit changes. Now let's move back to the code space or our local environment and we can see that the new file we just created cannot be found here. To make it visible here, we'll use git pull and now our changes are added to the repository. It doesn't matter if you had unsafe changes in your repository. In most cases, Git will make sure it all fits together.
