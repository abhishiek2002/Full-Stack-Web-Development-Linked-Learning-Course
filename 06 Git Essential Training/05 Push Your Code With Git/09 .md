Challenge: Push your first code
(bright electronic music) - We've covered a lot about Git so far, and now it's time for your first challenge. You're going to push your first piece of code to Git. To do so, first, you will create the remote repository. Now, open the repository in a GitHub codespace or in your local environment. Add a file for your favorite programming language. If you're not sure what to use, you can always use first push.md, which will create a markdown file. Once you are happy with the file, save it, and make sure you can make it available in the remote repository. Give it a try, you've got this.

Solution: Push your first code
(bright music) - [Instructor] If everything went smoothly, you should now have a remote repository with a file in your favorite language. To get there, you first created a new repository based on the templates. Then you opened up a code space or clone through your local environment. After that, you added your file. I've added Challenge01.md. You staged it with git add. You committed it with git commit, (keyboard clicks) and finally pushed it using git push. (keyboard clicks) And there we go. If you ran into any issues, don't worry. Take a moment to review the videos in this chapter. They'll help you guide through the process.
