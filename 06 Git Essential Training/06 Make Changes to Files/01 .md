Git status
- Now that we know how to use Git, let's explore how we interact with our files. First, I want to show some tips on how to make it easier to keep track of what is happening. One of the most powerful commands in Git is git status. We have seen it before in a previous chapter, but I want to take the time to look at how it can help us. git status gives you a clear overview of your repository's current state. It also often suggests what you might need to do next, especially if you run into an issue. Let's see it in action. Right here, I created a new file, gitStatusDemo.md It is added to my local folder, but Git doesn't track it yet. When I use git status, it shows that there's an untracked file, meaning it hasn't been added to the staging area. Git even tells me what I can do. I can use git add, filename, to include it in the next commit. So let's do that. I'll type git add gitStatusDemo.md, and now I'll run git status again. Now, Git tells me that there are changes ready to be committed. It also shows me how to move the file back to the working area if I change my mind. But in this case, I'm going to commit. I'll use git commit -m. Enter. After committing, let's check git status once more. Now it tells me that everything is clean, nothing left to commit. However, it also warns me that the local branch is ahead of the remote one, meaning I have commits that I haven't pushed yet. Git even suggests what to do next, use git push. Once I push my changes to the remote repository, I'll run git status again, and now it tells me everything is up to date. git status is an incredibly useful command. Whether you're troubleshooting, unsure about your next step, or you're just checking in, you can always use git status to see exactly where your repository is at that point.
