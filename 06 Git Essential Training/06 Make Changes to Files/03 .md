Delete files
- [Instructor] We've already added files and made changes to existing ones, but what happens if we delete a file? Let's find out. Let's go back to our repository. I am going to delete Example02.md. I'll press Delete and confirm that I want to delete it. Let's use git status to see how Git responds to this. It shows that the file has been deleted. If we want this change to follow through into the Git repository, we have to commit it like we would with any other changes. So, I'll stage it using git add . and then commit it with a message like Removes Example02.md. Git now shows that one file was changed and everything inside it was deleted. Now, let's push. And now, I can check my remote repository. When I refresh it, I see that Example02 has been deleted as well. I can still see the commit message though, and that's the important part. Even though the file has been deleted, Git still remembers it. It is still part of those old snapshots in the Git history. This means it's possible to recover or reference old versions whenever we need. We will see how we can do that in a later video in this chapter. It is good to mention that you can also delete files from the Git command line, but we will stick to this method to keep it simple.
