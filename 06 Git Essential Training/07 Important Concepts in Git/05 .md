Git commit messages
- [Instructor] Let's talk about commit messages. We've made quite a few commits by now and we've seen how useful they are for keeping track of changes. But the commit message itself is just as important. It tells us what actually happened in that commit. There are some best practices for writing commit messages that can make your Git history much clearer. First, a good commit message should describe exactly what changes were made. It should also be in the present tense. This might feel a little bit unnatural at first. You're probably used to saying, "I fixed something", but in a commit message it should be "fixes something". This way it is always clear that the commit reflects the change being made. The first line of a commit message should be no more than 50 characters. If that is not enough to fully describe the change, you can add a more detailed explanation underneath. Let's see what this looks like in practice. So if I go to my terminal and type git log oneline, I can see that those commit messages are pretty important. You could still wonder if, for example, "moves new name to first folder" is a good message. It's good to know what change was made, but it doesn't tell me why it happened. At the bottom, I can see "adds extra lines to demonstrate git diff", which is already a bit more helpful. For your own projects, these messages might not matter that much, but it is important to get into the habit of writing clear and meaningful commit messages. Now let me show you how you can create a multi-line commit message. I have a file called gitStatusDemo right here, and I am going to add a little bit of text right here. I'll press save and now I'm going to commit this. First, I'll add it to the staging area and I am ready to commit. So far we have been using git commit -m, and then a message. But what happens if we run git commit without -m? We see now that Git opens a text editor, the one that we set during installation. And the code space, it's Visual Studio Code itself. Here I can write a commit message across multiple lines. A good commit message starts with a short clear subject line. In this case, I might write, "Added LinkedInLearning to gitStatusDemo.md". Now, that's already pretty descriptive, but if I want to add more context, I can press enter twice and write a more detailed explanation below. For example, I could explain why I made this change. So in this example, I added that this commit doesn't have a real purpose, it's more about the commit message. I added some extra lines for readability. Especially with different text editors, this is always a good idea. Now, this is just a small example, but in a real project, this structure is really helpful. The subject line gives a quick summary while the body can provide extra details if needed. Once I close the editor, the commit is completed. If I check my history now with git log oneline, I'll only see the short subject line. But if I just run git log, I get the complete message including additional details. So it's a great habit to start practicing now. Writing clear, descriptive commit messages will make your Git history much easier to understand.
