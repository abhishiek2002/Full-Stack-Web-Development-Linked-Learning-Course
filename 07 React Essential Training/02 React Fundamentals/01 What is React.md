What is React?
- [Instructor] React is a JavaScript library that you can use to create user interfaces. It was created at Facebook and open sourced in March of 2013. Since then, react has expanded beyond the web with React Native, a tool that allows you to create native mobile applications using React. One of your best resources that you have at your disposal when learning React is the React documentation. Here, if you click on Learn, you can see all of the latest ways of creating a project. You can check in with the community, and there's also a blog where you can see the latest announcements about the library. React is a popular library with hundreds of thousands of stars on GitHub and is used in production by huge companies like PayPal, Netflix, and Microsoft. But the point of using React is not just because it's popular, but because it's fun to use and because its component architecture makes it faster and easier to build amazing products for the web and even for native platforms.
