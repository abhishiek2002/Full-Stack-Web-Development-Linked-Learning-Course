Working with JSX syntax
- [Instructor] Right now within this app function, we are returning a little blip of JSX. So JSX or JavaScript is XML is a syntax that you can use to write HTML like syntax right here in a React component right here in a JavaScript file. So not only can this handle hardcoded text, but it also can handle variables. So let's go ahead and create, I'll say language, I'll say JavaScript. Now, if I wanted to take this value and place it into this string, I could. I'll just replace World with an open and closed curly brace, and then I'll say language. So now if I run this project again, npm run dev, this is going to take whatever that value is and dynamically insert it into that string, so that if I change it, it will change here too. This works with all sorts of different things. So we could say let moon equal, I'll hit Control, Command, space. That will open up my emoji keyboard. I can type moon here, and then plug that in as a string. And then add that in another set of curly braces. (laughing) Okay. And then finally we can think of these as being a place where code can run. So what I mean by that is I could say language.toUpperCase. Add a string method here. And then that's going to start shouting that at me. So this is how I use JSX as sort of a templating language for my React code. I can create a variable, and then these variables can be injected into the body of the component using those curly braces.
