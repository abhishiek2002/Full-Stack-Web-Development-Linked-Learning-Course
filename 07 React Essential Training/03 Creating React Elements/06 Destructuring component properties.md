Destructuring component properties
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at a quick simplification that I can add to our header. Right now, it's taking in this entire props object so that every one of our properties that's sent in can be accessed by using dot notation, so we have props.name and props.year. So, another thing that we can take advantage of is destructuring these properties. So, instead of passing in the entire object, I'm going to say open and close curly brace, and we'll say name and year, then we can access them without having to use props. in each location, so we're being really granular about which fields we actually want to use. So, back to our application that's running, we should see that everything is being rendered appropriately, because I'm grabbing it off of the object with destructuring. So, if you ever see this syntax, just know that we're digging out these properties by their name, and then we can access them by name and year here in the body of our component. So, this is just a shorthand syntax so that we can destructure those values and make our code a little cleaner.
