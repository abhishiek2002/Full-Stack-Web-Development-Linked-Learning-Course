Learning the Node.js basics
- [Eve] If you've worked with JavaScript before, you might think of it just as a front-end technology, a way to add interactivity to web applications, to add features like button clicks and drop-downs. But that's not all JavaScript can do. With Node.js, you can use your JavaScript skills for more. Everything from building command line tools, to creating servers, to interacting with the file system. Since Node was released in 2009, companies like PayPal, Netflix, and Microsoft have used it as a way to build scalable event-driven applications. In this course, we'll cover the basic features of Node core, including standard input and standard output, the module system, and the file system, with consumable yet real-world examples. I'm Eve Porcello. I've been teaching Node to engineers for almost a decade, and I use it nearly every day in my own projects. These days, Node.js is everywhere, and it's a really great time to get acquainted with the basics. Now's the time to become a full-stack JavaScript developer with Node. Let's go.
