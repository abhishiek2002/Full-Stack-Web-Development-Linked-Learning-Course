What you should know
- [Instructor] Node.js Essential Training will provide you with an in-depth introduction to Node.js, but there are a couple things that you may want to be familiar with before you get started. First of all, Node.js is JavaScript, so you'll need to know a bit of JavaScript in order to work with Node.js successfully. If you'd like to learn more about JavaScript, check out the excellent JavaScript Essential Training with Morton Rand-Hendrikson. Also because we're dealing with the latest and greatest JavaScript syntax, a bit of ES6, ESNext, the latest JavaScript syntax would be great to know. You can check out my course Learning ECMAScript 6 or JavaScript Essential Training will use some of the syntax, as well. So if you feel comfortable with the JavaScript language, you are ready to become a full stack JavaScript developer with Node.js.
