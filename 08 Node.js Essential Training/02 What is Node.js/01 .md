Node.js history
- [Instructor] Node.js can feel like a brand new technology, but really, it's been around for about a decade and it's one of the most popular JavaScript tools available. Node.js was created by Ryan Doll in 2009 as a JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's VA engine. In 2011, npm, the node package manager, released version 1.0, which allowed for the sharing of open source node libraries. This marked a huge shift in the way that code was shared and maintained and started to cement node as a huge player in the ecosystem. After some infighting in the community about implementation and project management, the Node.js Foundation was formed in 2015. The Foundation is made up of several large companies, including IBM, Microsoft, PayPal and many, many others. And it's a collaborative project at the Linux Foundation. What this means is that these companies can shepherd the growth and the evolution of the library for many, many years to come. Today, the Node.js community is thriving with numerous conferences and events internationally and wide uses across various industries.
