More training
- [Instructor] Well, we made it. We made it all the way through our Node.js Essential Training course. You may be wondering, "What's next for me as I continue my learning journey with Node.js?" Well, what I'd recommend to you is that first, you take a look at Node.js Essential Training Part 2. This will take you through how to work with web servers in Node.js, how to deploy your Node.js applications, and much, much more. I'd also encourage you to check out Express.js. Express is a wonderful framework, one of the most popular for building web applications using Node. If you're looking to get into testing, I would recommend the Jest testing library. And when you're ready to deploy, I would check out Vercel or Netlify as great options. And, of course, stay on top of the Node.js documentation. This is where you'll learn the latest about what's up and coming in the language. I'm so glad that you took the time to learn Node.js with me today. I hope that this is a useful foundation for whatever you build with Node.
