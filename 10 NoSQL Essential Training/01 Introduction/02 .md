What you should know
- [Instructor] I know you've been waiting for this video. It's what you should know. So this course is a big picture. It's a mile high view of NoSQL. It doesn't get down into the nitty-gritty. If you're a developer who's trying to gain a general understanding of NoSQL, it's for you. If you're an entrepreneur learning about your product's options, it's for you. If you're a business executive or a manager or even if you're just plain nosy and want to understand what NoSQL is, then this course is for you. This course won't train you fully in any particular NoSQL query language, nor will it talk about the details of a given solution, but it will give you a sneak peek and a lay of the land so you can plan your NoSQL journey intelligently. At the very least, you'll learn some new words. Maybe I'll even bring a smile to your face here and there.
