Overview of NoSQL database types
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at different types of NoSQL storage. The first thing I want you to understand very clearly is that NoSQL is an umbrella term that describes a variety of non-relational databases. These are alternatives to traditional databases and there are four main types of these NoSQL databases. These four types differ from each other. Before we look at the differences between NoSQL types, let's look at some of the commonalities. NoSQL was developed to handle the LinkedIns, the Facebooks, Twitters, and Amazons of the world. These modern web applications need something that is scalable, always on. They need to handle a ton of data and data that isn't always neat and tidy. So they need to handle unstructured data. There are four main types of NoSQL databases. These include key-value, document, wide-column, and graph. In this module, we'll investigate these four types from a high-level perspective. Depending on your specific need, one might be better than another, and we'll investigate these specialties throughout the remainder of this chapter.
