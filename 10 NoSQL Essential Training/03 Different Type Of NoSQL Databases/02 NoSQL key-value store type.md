NoSQL key-value store type
- [Narrator] Let's investigate key value NoSQL databases. Overall key value stores are simple ways to store unstructured data for fast retrieval. Key and value can be anything. It's great for storing large amounts of data for simple querying. It's useful for things like caching and user preference storage. And if you're a developer, you can think of these as hash maps, dictionaries, et cetera. Some popular use cases according to Redis include caching for faster performance, session management, leaderboards, real-time inventory systems, fraud mitigation, and claims processing. Popular systems for key value databases include Redis, DynamoDB, and Oracle NoSQL amongst others. In Redis, this operation sets a given key and value. It's extremely simple to program.
