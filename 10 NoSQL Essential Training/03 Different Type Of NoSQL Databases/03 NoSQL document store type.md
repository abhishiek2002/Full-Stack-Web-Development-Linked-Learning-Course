NoSQL document store type
- [Instructor] Next, let's touch on NoSQL document databases. First, let's talk about what they are. Document databases are similar to key value databases, but the value in this case is stored as a document. For example, the popular document database MongoDB stores the document in a format called BSON. It stands for binary JSON, and as you might suspect, it's very similar to JSON. In fact as a developer, just think of it as JSON. The values within a document can be all sorts of types, from strings to objects, arrays, et cetera, akin to how developers type variables in their code. So it makes it very flexible and useful for agile development, and you should choose it when you need a ton of flexibility, but not a lot of complex queries. Document stores are considered general purpose in a way, Swiss Army knife types of no SQL databases, and they're useful for a wide variety of needs. They're often used for CMS systems, large document storage, websites, they're also useful in user profiles, as well as real time analytics and big data. Popular document storage systems include Apache's CouchDB, MongoDB, and Azure Cosmos DB. Finally, here's an example query in the document database MongoDB. You'll notice it's very similar to JSON syntax, making it simple and flexible for developers to work with.
