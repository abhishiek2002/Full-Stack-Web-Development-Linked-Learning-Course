NoSQL graph data store type
- [Instructor] Finally, let's talk about graph databases. And I have to tell you, graph databases happen to be my favorite type of NoSQL data store. And that's because they are so different than the other types. I mean, everything is stored in the form of an node or an edge that shows relationships between the nodes or attributes. And they are great when you want to show multidimensional relationships between different sets of data. Not so great when you want something general purpose though. So because they're relational nature, they're really well-suited for social networks where entities and their relationships are represented. Other use cases include fraud detection, recommendation engines. Some popular graph databases include Neo4j and JanusGraph. And cipher is Neo4j's graph query language. It allows users to store and retrieve data from the graph databases. And if you see here, it is a very good visual representation of what's happening and that's what the creators have tried to do here. They've made it intuitive from a visual perspective.
