Where NoSQL fails
- [Instructor] Of course, NoSQL isn't right for every scenario. Let's investigate its weaknesses. In general, NoSQL fails where you need consistency of data and I'm not referring to eventual consistency or even consistency for some users but the most accurate consistency. What are some use cases that fit this bill? Well, I'm pretty certain that any of us would be tremendously upset if our banking system wasn't consistent. What do you mean, bank, I have $10,000 in that account? You're seeing a negative balance? That doesn't fly for me. If you need your data to be consistent and really cannot tolerate trade-offs in this area then a relational database is most likely the right solution for you. On top of these super important data consistency transactions, If you have a need for complex SQL queries or if you have developers with strong SQL chops then NoSQL might not be the right fit. You might want to look at relational there. Sometimes you just have these small systems like I have a pet project for example or a small internal project. Maybe I don't need partition tolerance in this scenario then again relational might be the correct solution for you. In short, there's no one size fits all. Choose the right system based on your needs. Do you absolutely need accurate, consistent data? If so then a relational database might be right for you. Otherwise, take a look at some of your options with NoSQL databases.
