Introduction to vector databases
- [Instructor] With the rise of AI in recent years, it's important to recognize another NoSQL or NewSQL type of database, the vector database. Just like other NoSQL databases, vector databases handle data differently than traditional ones. A vector database manages data in a format known as vectors, which are arrays of numbers representing data points in a high dimensional space. These vectors are typically generated by machine learning models and represent complex data like images, text, and sounds in a way that machines can understand and process. Given the complexity of data in AI, vector databases have gained popularity by excelling at storing and retrieving data by distance or similarity. This is crucial for efficiently performing tasks such as searching for similar images, recommending products, or even detecting anomalies.
