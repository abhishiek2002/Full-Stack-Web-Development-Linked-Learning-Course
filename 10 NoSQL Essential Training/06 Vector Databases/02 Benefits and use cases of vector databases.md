Benefits and use cases of vector databases
- [Instructor] Vector databases are revolutionizing how we handle complex high dimensional data. Benefits of vector databases over both traditional SQL as well as other no SQL databases include their hands down efficiency in similarity search. Their support for complex, multidimensional vector embeddings, and their close integration with AI. They also have benefits of scalability, enhanced personalization, and more. There are a ton of uses for vector search, including semantic search, recommendation systems, image search, personalization systems, and more. Let's take a quick look at a couple of these in action. Recommendation systems are a popular use case. You've probably used these without even knowing it on sites like Amazon or Netflix. Here, this demo from Qdrant shows me foods similar to the ones I like. Let's try it out. Oh yep, there's a cheeseburger. And behind the scenes, vector embeddings and fast vector database indexes are at work to make this possible. Besides Qdrant, other popular vector databases include Weaviate, Pinecone, MongoDB's Atlas Vector Search, Chroma, and Redis.
