Next steps
- [Melanie] Thanks for joining me on this journey. But why stop here? I have a few potential next steps to offer you. First, connect with me on LinkedIn. Drop me a note that you took this course. Then feel free to look up We Can Code IT at wecancodeit.org. We provide online instructor-led and asynchronous training. Next, I encourage you to check out other courses on LinkedIn Learning in order to dive into NoSQL. How about checking our titles on MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, and Cassandra, depending on your interests? Finally, if you're into AI, why not try your hand at learning vector databases? I've reviewed several courses here, and they are stellar. Regardless of your next steps, congratulations! You've successfully completed this course. I hope you've learned something new and had a little fun in the process.
