Next steps
- [Morten] By watching this course you now have a foundational understanding of what REST APIs are and how they function. Now it's time to put that knowledge to work interacting with existing REST APIs and building your own. And we have a long list of courses for you to get started. Just search for REST and your favorite programming language or application to continue your journey of learning and start using REST APIs today. I love hearing from you about how you use what you've learned in my courses and I'm interested to hear how you're using REST APIs in your applications. You can follow me on LinkedIn and hit me up on Twitter @mor10 'cause that's my name where I talk about the web and the internet and how they shape us. Send me your questions, ideas, or random thoughts and I'll do my best to answer. Now all that's left for me to say is (speaks in foreign language) go build some amazing things with REST APIs and I'll see you in the next course.
